### Hello to all you curious and beautiful people ðŸ‘‹


#### My name is Kjell-Arne. I was born in 1975, and have since become the father of 6 girls, and 2 boys. In 2014 i took the step from using code ond dev as a hobby, and got employed at Truck Og Maskin AS as in-house developer. My work have lead to me starting to build an intranet portal to manage maintenence and repairs on industrial machinery, such as fork-lifts, wheel loaders, and the like. Starting 2022 i took 80% Educational leave from work to attend a Frontend Development class at Noroff Vocational School. On my freetime i spend time with my 4 kids who not yet left the nest, and occatioanly i get to spend time on my personal dev projects.
